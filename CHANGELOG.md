## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **Multi-HPA Watch Mode:** Added support for periodically watching all HPAs or multiple HPAs using `kubectl hpa status list --watch` or the `-w` shorthand.
- **Robust Color Table Rendering:** Handled ANSI escape character length dynamically with `lipgloss.Width` to fix column alignment issues in colored output.
- **Enhanced Non-Resource Metric Parsing:** Added ratio and note calculations for Pods, Object, and External metric sources using `resource.Quantity` ratios.
- **Sorting Enhancements:** Added support to sort by current-desired difference (`--sort-by=diff`) and resource age (`--sort-by=age`).
- **Comprehensive E2E integration test suite:** Added `test/e2e/e2e_test.go` running on a temporary local `kind` cluster context.
- **Phase 2 Edge-Case Unit Tests:** Covered 10% HPA tolerance boundaries, maxReplicas multi-metric winner cases, and custom stabilization windows.
- **CI/CD Workflow Improvements:** Added a automated `kind` cluster setup and E2E testing to the GitHub Actions workflow.

### Fixed
- Prioritized issues in `NewListItem` to bubble up `ERROR` and `LIMITED` conditions cleanly in list output.
- Escaped percent formatting in test assertions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Initial proof-of-concept release.
