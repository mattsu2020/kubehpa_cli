# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve `kubectl-hpa-status`.

## Development

```sh
make build
make test
make coverage
make lint
make release-check
```

Run the plugin locally:

```sh
./kubectl-hpa-status status <hpa-name> -n <namespace>
./kubectl-hpa-status list -A
./kubectl-hpa-status list -A --sort-by desired --filter scaling-limited
./kubectl-hpa-status scan
./kubectl-hpa-status status <hpa-name> --watch --timeout 2m
```

For cluster-backed validation, point `kubectl` at a disposable cluster and run:

```sh
kind create cluster --name hpa-status-dev
make e2e
kind delete cluster --name hpa-status-dev
```

When changing `--suggest`, `--fix`, or `--apply`, keep the workflow safe by
default. `--apply` must show the proposed patch diff, run as dry-run unless
`--dry-run=false` is explicitly set, and require confirmation unless `-y` is
provided.

## Adding interpretation rules

Interpretation rules live in `pkg/hpa/analysis.go`.
Concrete patch suggestions live in `pkg/hpa/suggestions.go`.

When adding a rule:

- prefer explicit HPA status fields over Event message parsing
- add a confidence label when the output is inferential
- avoid claiming the HPA controller's private intermediate recommendation
- add or update a focused unit test in `pkg/hpa/analysis_test.go`
- add command behavior tests in `cmd/root_integration_test.go` when flags or apply behavior change
- document any new user-facing output in `README.md`

For list output changes, update `pkg/hpa/text.go` and cover the table behavior
with tests. For command flags, add tests in `cmd/root_test.go` when the behavior
can be checked without a live cluster.

## Krew manifest

The Krew plugin name is intentionally `hpa-status`. Keep `.krew.yaml`,
GoReleaser archive names, and README install commands aligned when release
metadata changes.

## Commit style

Use Conventional Commits where practical:

```text
feat: add hpa list command
fix: avoid treating inactive desiredReplicas as scale down
test: cover tolerance-like no-scale interpretation
```

## Pull requests

Include:

- the user-visible behavior changed
- how it was tested
- any remaining HPA API ambiguity the implementation intentionally avoids claiming
